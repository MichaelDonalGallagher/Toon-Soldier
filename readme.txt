Two things that I couldn't get working was objects and enemies getting more red the more
they got shot and smoothing the camera turning. Neither of these issues are terrible 
though due to objects and enemies still being disabled after 10 shots and the camera still
following the player rather well.

Everything else should work fine though it has been a while since I've touched it so I may
be forgetting some details.
